# pywebir

`pywebir` is the preliminary name for a web-based infrared control system I'm
working on that's primarily designed for controlling in-window air
conditioners. It uses a [USB IR
Toy](http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/USB_Infrared_Toy) and a [Raspberry
Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) to accomplish the task.
